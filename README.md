# Elegant Programming Cheatsheet

Creation of **Elegant Programming Cheatsheet** was inspired by Yegor Bugayenko's [blog](https://www.yegor256.com/).
He is an author or [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org/) where he challenges traditional OO techniques.
The goal here is to create a convenient reference to some of Yegor's blog posts that developers can keep in front of them 
while writing code.
